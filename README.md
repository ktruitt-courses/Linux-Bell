# Linux-Bell
Linux Bell upon completion will integrate with Software-Based PBX systems, and use a web gui to manage bells and sound files. This project is highly inspired by Acrovista's Bell Commander.

Project Roadmap:
- March 13th - April 1st (Initiation of Project, 1st Beta Release.)
- April 3rd - April 20th (Minor Touch-ups, and release of version #1.)
